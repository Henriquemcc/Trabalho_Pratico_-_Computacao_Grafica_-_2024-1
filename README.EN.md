# Practical Work - Algorithms Implementation Unit 1 - Computer Graphics

## Statement

### Goal

This work aims to complement the knowledge obtained in the Computer Graphics discipline with the development of a practical application, which involves the use of input and output different from the standard keyboard/console. It is mandatory that the result is presented graphically in a structure corresponding to the matrix
pixels (Drawing Area).

This application can be developed in any programming language and platform, as long as the items requested in Section 3 of this document are made available.

The work is individual and copies will be made zero!

### Development

The content to be implemented must include the following items:

a) 2D geometric transformations: translation, rotation, scale and X/Y/XY reflections with transformation factors entered by the user (without using fixed values)

b) Rasterization:
- Straights - DDA, Bresenham
- Circumference – Bresenham

c) Cutout:
- Coded regions – Cohen-Sutherland
- Parametric equation – Liang-Barsky

The data structure must include vertices/points, lines and polygons, so that they can be selected through a rectangular region indicated via the interface. Remember that the use of the keyboard should be avoided and information should be provided by clicks (or similar events, such as touch) in the Drawing Area or similar structure.

### Work Delivery and Assessment

The following must be delivered:
1. **Working code: commented, indented and organized. Deliver the complete project**;
2. videos with the tests performed **with screenshot and explanatory audio**;
3. executable or corresponding (or download link);
4. installer for Windows with option to make libraries and components available.

In addition to the content, the form of presentation, the correctness in the use of the Portuguese language and the clarity in the presentation of the arguments will be evaluated.

Works delivered after the stipulated date will not be accepted. If the complete project with source code is not delivered, the work will not be accepted.
